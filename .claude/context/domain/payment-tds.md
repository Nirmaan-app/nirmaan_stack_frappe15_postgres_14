# Payment TDS — tax withheld, and the challan it is paid under

⚠️ **"TDS" HERE IS TAX DEDUCTED AT SOURCE.** This repo also uses "TDS" for **TECHNICAL DATA SHEET**
(`TDS Items`, `TDS Repository`, `Project TDS Setting`, the `/tds-repository` + `/tds-approval`
routes). Same three letters, unrelated concepts, different owners. A grep for `tds` lands on both
families and they must never be reconciled with each other.

Two halves: **withholding** the tax from a vendor payment (`services/payment_tds.py`, pre-existing)
and **paying** it to the department under a challan (this doc's additions, 2026-09).

---

## The two doctypes

**`Payment TDS Deduction`** — one deduction, one payment.

| Field | Note |
|---|---|
| `project_payment` | Link → Project Payments. **UNIQUE, and that constraint IS the idempotency guarantee** — only the first Approved transition can write a row, which is also what stops the amount being netted twice. |
| `gross_amount` | The amount BEFORE tax. ⚠️ The only surviving record of it: `Project Payments.amount` is rewritten to the net. |
| `tds_percentage` | The rate AS APPLIED, snapshotted. Never re-read from the vendor — 561 of 629 rows differ from their vendor's rate today. |
| `tds_amount` | `gross × rate / 100`. What `Service Requests.total_tds` sums (Paid payments only). |
| `payment_approved_on` | The day the payment reached Approved. Renamed from `deducted_on` (2026-09-12). |
| `deducted_on` | ⚠️ **RETIRED, READ-ONLY, FROZEN.** The pre-rename copy, kept until the owner drops the column by hand. Nothing writes it, so rows created after the rename leave it empty — never read it as the live date. |
| `status` | `Pending` → `Paid`. Written by the Pay TDS action, never by hand. |
| `tds_challan` | Link → TDS Challan Attachment. |

**`TDS Challan Attachment`** — one ITNS 281 receipt.

Carries financial year, amount, mode of payment, bank + bank reference, date of deposit, BSR code,
challan no, tender date and the attachment.

- **Duplicate key: Amount + Bank Reference Number + BSR Code + Challan No.** All four matching means
  the same receipt uploaded twice. The site is Postgres (case-sensitive), so the text parts are
  trimmed and the bank reference upper-cased before the lookup.
- `bsr_code` / `challan_no` are **Data, not Int** — both carry meaningful leading zeros (`00069`).
- `reconciled_amount` is **read-only and server-owned** (see below). Remaining balance is
  `amount - reconciled_amount`, derived at the point of use, never stored.

**`Project Payments.payment_tds`** — Link → Payment TDS Deduction, **read-only**. A MIRROR, not the
authority: `project_payment` above is the real link. The service writes it when the deduction is
recorded and repairs it on the next save if blank. ⚠️ The self-heal only fills a BLANK one; it does
not correct a wrong value.

---

## `reconciled_amount` — the one rule, and the bug it already caused

**A challan's `reconciled_amount` IS the sum of the deductions pointing at it.** It is always
**RECOMPUTED FROM SOURCE, never adjusted by a delta** — a `+=` on pay and a `-=` on delete would be
two arithmetic paths that must agree forever.

The rule lives in **`services/payment_tds.recompute_challan_reconciled`** — in the service, not in
`api/`, because a CONTROLLER must be able to call it and a controller may not import from `api/`.
It is the **only writer** of that field.

Three callers, and none is redundant:

| Caller | Covers |
|---|---|
| `api/tds_challan/pay_tds` | Paying. Adds its own over-application guard before writing. |
| `controllers/project_payments.on_trash` | The payment cascade, which deletes the deduction with **raw SQL that fires no hooks**. |
| `controllers/payment_tds_deduction.on_trash` | A doc-layer delete (Desk, REST) — the route the raw delete bypasses. |

⚠️ **MEASURED BUG (2026-09-15), fixed:** deleting a payment deleted its deduction, but nothing
recomputed — a challan sat at ₹150 used with **zero** deductions behind it, permanently ₹150 short
of usable balance. That is what the second and third callers exist for.

---

## Paying — `api/tds_challan/pay_tds.py`

- `pay_tds(deductions, challan)` — spend an existing challan's balance.
- `create_challan_and_pay(deductions, challan_data)` — mint the challan and pay in the **same
  transaction**, so a challan is never left created-but-unused.

Both take a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` lock on the challan **before reading anything**, then re-check
every selected deduction inside that lock (still Pending, still unlinked). ⚠️ **The client's total
is never trusted** — the amount is summed from the database rows, because the browser's figure was
computed before the lock existed. A selection exceeding the challan's remaining balance is refused,
naming the shortfall; there is **no partial payment and no splitting one deduction across two
challans**.

---

## Editing a payment that already carries a deduction

⚠️ **THE EDITED AMOUNT IS THE NET.** Once a deduction exists, `Project Payments.amount` IS what left
the bank, so an edit to it is an edit to the net. `restate_deduction_on_amount_change` re-derives:

```
gross = net / (1 - rate/100)        tds = gross - net
```

at the deduction's **own snapshotted rate**, then recomputes the challan and re-syncs the parent's
`total_tds`.

- ⚠️ **It must NOT re-net the payment.** `write_deduction` rewrites `amount` once, at creation;
  doing it again would shrink the payment on every edit, compounding.
- ⚠️ **It sits ABOVE the status early-return in `on_update`**, which returns when the status has not
  changed — an amount edit changes no status, so everything below that line is unreachable for it.
  Same placement reason as the `after_insert` call.
- A **raise** that would over-apply a challan already paid is **refused**, aborting the edit. A
  reduction always fits.

## Reading the challan off a receipt (Gemini)

`doc_kind="tds_challan"` on the shared `services/extraction/` seam plus
`api/tds_challan_autofill.extract_challan_fields`. Nothing is persisted — the response fills a form
the user corrects.

- `bsr_code` / `challan_no` stay **strings** so leading zeros survive.
- `mode_of_payment` is **snapped to the doctype's Select options**, else blank — an unrecognised
  value fails Frappe's own option check on insert.
- ⚠️ The extracted **amount is cross-checked against the receipt's own tax breakup**, because that
  figure becomes the ceiling on what can be paid against the challan; a misread would cap every
  later payment silently. The financial-year check is format-only, so an Assessment-Year misread
  (`2026-27`) passes it — the prompt and the amber tint are the only guards there.

---

## Frontend

Reports hub → **Payment TDS Deduction** tab (report type "TDS Deduction"), gated by
`PAYMENT_TDS_ACCESS`. `/payment-tds-deductions` redirects into it.

- Checkbox selection is limited to **Pending** rows; a paid row's checkbox is disabled and
  select-all skips it. ⚠️ Turning selection on also re-aims **Export** at the selection (the shared
  DataTable gates both on one prop).
- **Pay TDS** button carries the count and rounded total; the dialog has two arms — old challan, or
  upload → Gemini → create + pay. The upload shows the drop zone alone until a file lands: a failed
  **upload** keeps the form hidden (no receipt, no challan), a failed **read** opens it blank with
  the reason.
- **View Challans** lists every challan *including fully-used ones* — the picker answers "what can I
  pay from?", this answers "what have we deposited?".
- Project / Payment / Gross / Net columns are **hidden by default**, not deleted (⚠️ hiding `project`
  also removes its facet dropdown).

## Patches

| Patch | Does |
|---|---|
| `rename_deducted_on_to_payment_approved_on` | Copies the dates across. **Drops nothing** — the owner drops the old column by hand. |
| `backfill_payment_tds_deduction_link` | Fills `Project Payments.payment_tds` for the 626 existing rows. |

Both are idempotent and fill only what is still empty.

---

## Known gaps

- **No reversal or unlink path.** A deduction is deleted with its payment; nothing detaches one from
  a challan. Any future unlink must reuse `recompute_challan_reconciled`, never subtract.
- The mirror self-heal fills a blank, not a wrong value.
- A challan that drifted before the fix stays wrong until something is paid against it (the pay path
  recomputes). One such row exists on localhost by owner decision.
- Gemini challan extraction has never run against a real challan file; none of the UI has been
  verified in a browser.
