# BoQ Upload & Management — Implementation Plan

**Status:** Phase 2a (Reader + Mapping Config schema) complete. Phase 2b (parsing engine) ready to draft.
**Owner:** Internal team.
**Last updated:** 2026-05-09 (after Phase 2a completion + working agreement #11 added).
**Active branch:** `feature/boq-phase-2`

> This is the active implementation plan. Long-term domain documentation will be moved to `.claude/context/domain/boq.md` after Phase 3 stabilizes. Decisions log is at the end of this file.

---

## 1. Overview

Upload Bill of Quantities (BoQ) Excel files for projects, parse them into a structured hierarchical form, edit with audit, and use the parsed line items as anchors for downstream linkages — Work Headers / Milestones, Critical PO Tasks, PR/PO line items, and Delivery records.

BoQs in the wild are non-standard: variable column layouts, multi-level nested preambles, supply-and-install rates sometimes separate, sometimes combined. The system must accommodate this without rigid templates.

## 2. Goals

- Upload `.xlsx` BoQs and convert them into a queryable, editable structured form.
- Preserve hierarchy: **L1 Preamble → L2 Preamble → L3 Preamble → Line Item**.
- Multiple BoQs per project (e.g. Civil + MEP).
- Line items are the anchor for downstream linkages.
- Editable post-import with full audit trail.
- Robust against real-world Excel inconsistencies.

## 3. Non-goals (this iteration)

- Auto-generation of BoQs from drawings.
- Cross-project BoQ benchmarking.
- Vendor portal BoQ submission.
- Replacement of existing Work Headers / Milestones doctypes (we link to them, we don't replace them).

## 4. Users and access

Internal team only. Permissions follow project membership conventions used by `Procurement Requests` and `Procurement Orders`. CEO Hold (`integrations/controllers/projects.py`) gates any procurement-related actions in Phase 7.

## 5. Core design decisions

### 5.1 Parsing strategy: manual mapping + AI assist

Two approaches, used together:

- **Option B — Manual mapping UI.** User uploads any Excel, sees a preview, marks columns (Description, Qty, Unit, Supply Rate, Install Rate, etc.) and rows (L1/L2/L3 preamble, line item, header, total, skip). Examples-based fill auto-classifies similar rows.
- **Option C — AI assist.** Claude API pre-fills column mapping and row classifications. User reviews and corrects.

AI is used for **structural classification only** — what each row/column means. Numerical values (qty, rates) are always read deterministically from cells, never from AI output. Non-negotiable for financial data.

### 5.2 Tree storage: self-referencing Link with denormalized path

`BOQ Nodes` is a standalone doctype with a self-referencing `parent_node` Link and a denormalized `path` field (`"node_id_1/node_id_12/node_id_45"`).

We do **not** use Frappe's `is_tree` / lft+rgt nested sets — there's no precedent in this codebase, BoQ trees are small (hundreds of nodes), and TanStack Table's `getSubRows` natively renders self-referenced trees client-side. Recursive CTEs on Postgres handle subtree queries. The `path` field gives cheap subtree filtering when needed.

### 5.3 Hierarchical model

Preambles can nest to any positive depth (level ≥ 1). A soft warning is emitted above level 5 (unusual but allowed). Line items belong to the deepest preamble in their ancestor chain. Standalone line items (no parent) are allowed — they receive a warning but save successfully.

The original L1/L2/L3 constraint was too rigid for real-world BoQs which sometimes nest 4–6 levels deep. The stack-walk algorithm already handles arbitrary depth without changes; the validation layer was the only restriction.

### 5.4 Versioning

Each upload is a new version. Previous versions are marked Superseded, never deleted. Downstream linkages remain attached to the version they were created against. Carry-over of links across versions is a Phase 7e concern.

### 5.5 Tax treatment

Per-BoQ flag: `pre_tax` (default) or `post_tax`. Rates stored as captured.

### 5.6 Editability and audit

Line items editable post-import. Audit follows the **Nirmaan Versions pattern** already used for PRs/POs/SRs/payments — independently queryable, business-meaningful. We do not use a child-table audit log. Every edit captures a `reason`. If `Nirmaan Versions` lacks a `reason` field, add it (cross-cutting improvement; benefits other doctypes too).

### 5.7 Multiple BoQs per project

A project can have multiple co-existing BoQs (e.g. Civil, MEP, Electrical) as separate documents.

### 5.8 BoQ Nodes are standalone documents, not child rows

Following the Critical PO Tasks precedent. Nodes are individually queryable, updatable, and audit-loggable. Do not store nodes as a child table or JSON field on the BOQ — that's a known migration trap (see `procurement_list` → `order_list` history).

### 5.9 AI provider for Phase 4: Anthropic Claude API

Document AI is built for structured form extraction (invoices, IDs) and is unsuited to free-form spreadsheets with arbitrary layouts. The architectural pattern of `services/document_ai.py` and `api/invoice_autofill.py` is mirrored — opt-in, file_url-based, confirm-before-save, never auto-persist — but the underlying service is Anthropic's API. Model: `claude-sonnet-4-6`.

### 5.10 BoQ → downstream relationships are via dedicated linkage doctypes

In Phase 7 we create one linkage doctype per relationship type, each following the Critical PO Tasks pattern (standalone documents). BoQ Nodes do **not** auto-create Work Headers, Milestones, PRs, or POs — users explicitly create the linkages.

We avoid the legacy `$#,,,` delimiter pattern used in milestone reports.

## 6. Data model

### 6.1 BOQs

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| name | string (auto) | Frappe ID |
| project | Link → Projects | required |
| boq_name | Data | e.g. "Civil BoQ v1" |
| version | Int | auto-incremented per (project, boq_name) |
| status | Select | Draft / Approved / Superseded |
| tax_treatment | Select | Pre-tax (default) / Post-tax |
| uploaded_by | Link → User | |
| uploaded_at | Datetime | |
| parsed_at | Datetime | |
| notes | Text | |

Source `.xlsx` is stored via **Nirmaan Attachments** (`associated_doctype = "BOQs"`, `associated_docname = name`), matching how PR/PO/SR attachments work.

### 6.2 BOQ Nodes

Single self-referencing table for both preambles and line items.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| name | string (auto) | Frappe ID |
| boq | Link → BOQs | required |
| parent_node | Link → BOQ Nodes | nullable; null for L1 preambles and orphans |
| node_type | Select | `Preamble` / `Line Item` |
| level | Int | 1, 2, or 3 for preambles; null for line items |
| sort_order | Int | preserves Excel row order within siblings |
| code | Data | optional dotted code, e.g. "1.2.3" |
| description | Text | required |
| source_row_number | Int | which Excel row this came from |
| path | Data | slash-separated ancestor IDs, denormalized |
| **Line item / amount fields** (null for preambles unless leaf): | | |
| unit | Data | |
| qty | Float | nullable; 0 is valid (rate-only items) |
| supply_rate | Currency | nullable |
| install_rate | Currency | nullable |
| combined_rate | Currency | nullable |
| supply_amount | Currency | computed unless explicitly overridden |
| install_amount | Currency | computed unless explicitly overridden |
| total_amount | Currency | computed sum |
| is_rate_only | Check | auto-set when qty=0 and at least one rate is set; common in tender BoQs |
| notes | Text | |

Indexes: `boq`, `parent_node`, `path` (for prefix queries).

### 6.3 Validation rules (in `integrations/controllers/boq_nodes.py`)

- If `node_type = "Line Item"`: `qty` must not be `None` (0 is valid for rate-only items); `level` must be null; at least one rate field should be set (warn if none).
- If `node_type = "Preamble"`: `level` must be a positive integer ≥ 1; warn (do not throw) if `level > 5`; qty/rates on a **non-leaf** preamble emit a warning (leaf preambles may carry qty/rate for tender computation — silent); `amount_override` suppresses the non-leaf warning.
- `parent_node` consistency (generic rule): a preamble at level N must have a parent at level N−1; a line item's parent must be a preamble (any level); standalone nodes (`parent_node` null) are allowed with a warning.
- `path` recomputed on save and on parent changes.
- `is_rate_only` auto-set in `before_save`: true when `qty == 0` and at least one rate field is set; false otherwise.
- Amount fields auto-computed from qty × rate unless `amount_override` is set. When `qty == 0` and rates are set, amounts compute to 0 correctly (`(supply or install)` logic replaced with `any([supply_rate, install_rate])` check).

### 6.4 Audit

Use **Nirmaan Versions** pattern. Phase 1 task: confirm Nirmaan Versions schema; if it lacks a `reason` field, add one. Every BOQ Node update from a user (post-initial-import) writes a Nirmaan Versions entry with the change diff and reason.

## 7. Parsing pipeline

### 7.1 Stages (`services/boq_excel_parser.py`)

1. **Read** — open `.xlsx` with `openpyxl` (already in `pyproject.toml`). Read both `data_only=True` (evaluated values) and `data_only=False` (formulas) to detect computed cells. Capture cell formatting: bold, indent, fill color, merged ranges, font size.
2. **Configure mapping** — accept a config dict: `{header_row, column_role_map, code_column, preamble_detection_rules}`.
3. **Classify rows** — assign each row a type: `preamble_L1`, `preamble_L2`, `preamble_L3`, `line_item`, `header`, `total`, `skip`. Three signals in priority order:
   - **Code-driven:** if a code column is mapped and value matches a dotted pattern (`1`, `1.2`, `1.2.3`), level = dot count + 1.
   - **AI classification** (Phase 4): pre-applied as starting point.
   - **Rule-driven fallback:** bold + no qty + indent depth → preamble of computed level; has qty + has rate → line item.
4. **Resolve hierarchy** — stack-walk algorithm (see 7.2).
5. **Validate** — flag warnings: orphans, empty preambles, level skips, missing units, total mismatches.
6. **Persist** — create BOQ + BOQ Nodes records in a single transaction.

### 7.2 Hierarchy resolution algorithm (deterministic)

```python
def assign_parents(classified_rows):
    # stack maps level (any positive int) -> node_id
    # Algorithm is depth-agnostic: handles L1..L3 and L1..LN equally
    stack = {}

    for row in classified_rows:
        if row.type == 'preamble':
            level = row.level  # any positive integer ≥ 1
            # Truncate stack: anything at level ≥ current is no longer an ancestor
            stack = {k: v for k, v in stack.items() if k < level}
            row.parent_id = stack.get(level - 1)  # None if level == 1 (root preamble)
            row.id = create_node(row)
            stack[level] = row.id

        elif row.type == 'line_item':
            if stack:
                deepest_level = max(stack.keys())
                row.parent_id = stack[deepest_level]
            else:
                row.parent_id = None  # standalone — flag warning, still saved
            row.id = create_node(row)
```

Handles: L1 directly followed by line items, L2 → L1 transitions, arbitrary nesting depth (L4, L5, …), uneven trees, standalone line items.

### 7.3 Examples-based row classification

After user marks a few exemplar rows, classify remaining by feature similarity:

- Features per row: indent level, bold/non-bold, has-qty, has-rate, fill color, font size, code pattern depth.
- Algorithm: nearest-neighbor over the feature vector. Rows matching a labeled exemplar with high overlap inherit the label.
- Ambiguous rows go to a "needs review" bucket shown to the user.

## 8. AI assist (Phase 4)

### 8.1 Architecture

`services/boq_ai_assist.py` mirrors `services/document_ai.py` shape:

- Receives `file_url`.
- Reads and converts top ~50–100 rows to a structured representation including formatting metadata.
- Calls Anthropic API (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) via `frappe.enqueue` (background job).
- Returns JSON: `{header_row, column_roles, row_classifications, confidences, reasoning_for_low_confidence}`.
- Caches result per file_url (don't re-call on revisit).
- Logs token usage.

### 8.2 Prompt (template, iterate against fixture corpus)

> "This is the top of a Bill of Quantities Excel sheet. Identify:
> 1. The row containing column headers.
> 2. For each column, its semantic role from: description, qty, unit, supply_rate, install_rate, combined_rate, supply_amount, install_amount, total_amount, code, skip.
> 3. For each data row, classify as: preamble_L1, preamble_L2, preamble_L3, line_item, header, total, skip.
>
> Use indentation, font weight, fill color, numbering pattern (e.g. '1.' is L1, '1.1' is L2, '1.1.1' is L3), and presence/absence of qty/rate values. A row with bold text and no qty is likely a preamble; level is determined by indentation or numbering depth.
>
> Return JSON only, with this schema: {…}. Include a 0–1 confidence per column and per row, plus a one-line reasoning for low-confidence rows."

### 8.3 Guards

- AI output is a *suggestion*; user must confirm.
- Numerical values (qty, rates) NEVER taken from AI output.
- Cap input at 100 rows per call.
- Cache result per file_url; never re-call on revisit.
- Log token usage.
- Confirm-before-save flow consistent with `invoice_autofill.py`.

## 10. Frontend code placement

Match the **project creation wizard** structure exactly (`frontend/src/pages/projects/project-form/`).

```

**Reference implementations to study before writing each step:**

- `frontend/src/pages/projects/project-form/index.tsx` — orchestrator
- `frontend/src/pages/projects/project-form/schema.ts` — Zod patterns
- `frontend/src/pages/projects/project-form/steps/PackageSelectionStep.tsx` — toggleable optional sections (model for "manual vs AI parse mode")
- `frontend/src/pages/projects/project-form/steps/ReviewStep.tsx` — model for ParsedPreviewStep and ConfirmStep
- `frontend/src/zustand/useProjectDraftStore.ts` — draft store pattern with persist
- `frontend/src/hooks/useProjectDraftManager.ts` — persistence logic
- `frontend/src/components/ui/project-creation-dialog.tsx` — multi-stage progress dialog

**Tech stack constraints (from CLAUDE.md):**

- All Frappe access via `frappe-react-sdk`. No raw `fetch`.
- TanStack Table v8 for the tree view (use `getSubRows`). Use `useServerDataTable` `clientData` mode for fully-loaded trees.
- shadcn/ui for primitives; Ant Design only when matching nearby pages.
- Date formatting: `formatDate()` from `src/utils/FormatDate.ts`, dd-MMM-yyyy.
- `FuzzySearchSelect` for dropdowns with >50 options.
- `getSelectStyles()` inside Radix dialogs.
- Real-time events: `boq:created`, `boq:node:updated`, `boq:parse:complete`, wired via `SocketInitializer.tsx`.
- Routes added in `src/components/helpers/routesConfig.tsx` under `<ProtectedRoute><MainLayout>`.

## 11. UX flow

1. **Step 1 — Upload.** Pick project, name BoQ, drop `.xlsx`, choose tax treatment. Optional toggle: "Use AI assist" (Phase 4+).
2. **Step 2 — Mapping.** Sheet rendered as table preserving merged cells, bold, indentation. AI runs in background if enabled; spinner. Once ready, suggestions overlay applied (column roles labeled, rows colored by type, low-confidence cells flagged). User clicks columns → role dropdown; clicks rows → type dropdown; drag-selects for bulk; "Auto-classify similar rows" runs examples-based fill.
3. **Step 3 — Parsed preview.** Tree view of resolved hierarchy (TanStack Table with `getSubRows`). Inline-edit any field. Validation warnings panel.
4. **Step 4 — Confirm and save.** Multi-stage progress dialog (uploading → parsing → saving nodes).
5. **View.** Tree view of saved BoQ. Search, filter, export to Excel.

## 12. Edge cases (carry from earlier design)

| Case | Handling |
|---|---|
| L1 directly followed by line items | Stack-walk handles; line item parent = L1. |
| L2 followed by L1 | Stack truncates to empty on L1. |
| Same preamble title twice under different L1s | Separate nodes, no dedup. |
| Preamble with qty/rate (rare) | Allowed in schema with override flag; warn. |
| Mid-row preamble | Stack-walk handles. |
| Multiple disciplines stacked in one sheet | L1 boundaries separate them. Future "split here" UI. |
| Multiple sheets in one Excel | Open question — see §15. |
| Subtotal / Grand Total rows | Classify as `total`, skip in import, recompute fresh. Warn on mismatch. |
| Merged cells in description column | Use top-left cell value. |
| Cells with formulas | Read evaluated value; metadata flag computed=true. |
| Empty preambles | Warn, allow save. |
| Orphan line items | Warn, allow save with `parent_node = null`. |
| Level skip (L1 → L3) | Warn, allow save. |

## 13. Phasing

Each phase = one feature branch (`feature/boq-phase-<N>`) → review → merge before next phase.

### Phase 0 — Project context *(complete)*
- `CLAUDE.md` enriched.
- This plan committed at `frontend/.claude/plans/boq-upload-plan.md`.
- Decisions log at end of this file.

### Phase 1 — Data model + manual entry *(2–3 days)*
- Doctypes: `BOQs`, `BOQ Nodes`. JSON schemas as in §6.
- Controllers in `integrations/controllers/`. Validation, path computation, amount auto-computation.
- Audit: confirm Nirmaan Versions schema; add `reason` field if missing; wire BOQ Node changes to write Nirmaan Versions entries.
- `hooks.py` `doc_events` updates.
- Real tests covering: path computation, amount computation, validation rules per node_type, parent-child consistency, audit log creation. Use `FrappeTestCase`. Aim for genuine coverage, not stubs.
- Permissions: match Procurement Requests / Procurement Orders conventions.
- **Exit:** can manually create a BoQ tree via Frappe Desk; tests pass.

### Phase 2a — Reader + Mapping Config schema ✅ COMPLETE

**What it built:**
- Pydantic-based `MappingConfig` schema with full validation (column letters, area dimensions, role uniqueness, master_preamble vs data sheet types)
- `BoqReader` class wrapping openpyxl with: `list_sheets()` preserving exact names including whitespace, `get_sheet_dimensions()` (content-based), `iter_rows()` with lazy iteration, `detect_header_row()` heuristic, `detect_blank_columns()`, `get_master_preamble_text()`
- `RawRow` + `CellInfo` dataclasses capturing computed values, formulas, merged ranges, bold, fill, indent
- Synthetic fixture generator producing 5 `.xlsx` test fixtures (committed to repo)
- 32 new tests (14 config + 18 reader), all passing. Phase 1.x: 77/77 still passing.

**Two bugs fixed during implementation:**
1. `detect_blank_columns` couldn't see column Z because openpyxl's `max_column` only reflects written columns. Fixed by writing empty string to Z1 in fixture to extend `max_column`.
2. Empty sheets produced phantom blank row because openpyxl's `max_row` defaults to 1. Fixed by content-based dimension detection in `iter_rows` when `end_row` not specified.

**Branch:** `feature/boq-phase-2` (new branch from `feature/boq-phase-1`)

### Phase 2 — Excel parsing engine (backend only) *(4–5 days)*
- `services/boq_excel_parser.py`: reader, mapping config schema (dataclass / Pydantic), classifier (code-driven + rule-driven), hierarchy resolver (stack walk), validator.
- Sample BoQ corpus: 3–5 anonymized real `.xlsx` files under `tests/fixtures/boq_samples/`. Each has an expected JSON.
- Parser unit tests covering all sample BoQs and every edge case in §12.
- No frontend, no AI, no whitelisted endpoints yet.
- **Exit:** from Frappe console, `parse_boq(file_url, config)` returns correct structured output for all samples.

### Phase 3 — Upload + mapping UI (manual flow) *(5–7 days)*
- Whitelisted APIs: `upload.py`, `parse.py`, `save.py` under `nirmaan_stack/api/boq/`.
- Frontend: BoQ upload wizard mirroring project-form structure (see §10). Steps: Upload, Mapping, ParsedPreview, Confirm.
- Excel preview with TanStack Table preserving formatting cues.
- Column role assignment (click header → dropdown). Row classification (click row → type dropdown). Drag-select for bulk. "Auto-classify similar rows" examples-based fill.
- Validation warnings panel.
- Multi-stage progress dialog mirroring `project-creation-dialog.tsx`.
- **Exit:** real user uploads a real BoQ Excel, manually maps, saves; saved data matches Excel.

### Phase 4 — AI assist *(3–4 days)*
- `services/boq_ai_assist.py` mirroring `services/document_ai.py`. Anthropic API integration. Prompt iteration against fixture corpus.
- `api/boq/ai_assist.py` whitelisted endpoint, background job dispatch.
- Frontend: spinner on Mapping step, suggestions overlay applied, confidence display, low-confidence rows highlighted.
- Cost guards: row cap, caching, token logging.
- **Exit:** typical BoQ requires <30s of correction after AI pre-fill.

### Phase 5 — Edit + audit UI *(2–3 days)*
- Inline editing of saved BoQ Nodes with reason capture (modal).
- Audit log viewer per node (reads from Nirmaan Versions).
- Re-upload as new version: creates v2 BoQ, marks v1 as Superseded. Carry-over of links is stubbed.
- **Exit:** users can fix typos with full audit trail.

### Phase 6 — Read views, search, export *(3–5 days)*
- BoQ list per project.
- Tree view with collapse/expand per preamble.
- Search across line items by description.
- Filter by preamble.
- Export back to Excel.
- Roll-up summaries: total supply value, total install value, value per L1.
- Basic version diff view.
- **Exit:** PMs can browse a BoQ end-to-end without opening the original Excel.

### Phase 7 — Linkage layer *(2–4 weeks, sub-phased)*

Each sub-phase gets its own design doc. All linkages are standalone doctypes following the Critical PO Tasks pattern. CEO Hold check required before any procurement-creating action.

- **7a — Work Header / Milestone linkage.** New doctype `BOQ Node Milestone Link`. UI to map BoQ Nodes to existing Work Headers / Work Milestones (no replacement of existing entities).
- **7b — Critical PO Category linkage.** New doctype `BOQ Node Critical PO Link`. Map BoQ Nodes to Critical PO Tasks. Coordinate with active plans `frontend/.claude/plans/critical-po-setup-plan.md` and `critical-po-tracker-project-view.md`.
- **7c — PR / PO line item linkage.** New doctypes `BOQ Node PR Item Link`, `BOQ Node PO Item Link`. When creating a PR/PO, optionally pick from BoQ line items. Pre-fills item details.
- **7d — Delivery linkage.** New doctype `BOQ Node Delivery Link`. Track delivered qty per line item. Show "delivered vs BoQ qty" progress in the tree view.
- **7e — Version migration.** When v2 of a BoQ is uploaded, surface a UI to map v1 nodes → v2 nodes so existing linkages carry over.

## 14. Working agreements

- Before each phase, output a written plan; user reviews; then code.
- One feature branch per phase: `feature/boq-phase-<N>`.
- Doctype changes go through `bench --site <site> migrate`. New patches in `patches/` only when backfilling data on existing doctypes.
- All Python lifecycle logic in `integrations/controllers/`. Doctype `.py` stays minimal.
- All API endpoints under `nirmaan_stack/api/boq/`, snake_case.
- Frontend: shadcn/ui + TanStack Table + Zustand + frappe-react-sdk + React Hook Form + Zod. No new UI libraries.
- Pure-Python modules (parser, AI assist) get real unit tests with fixtures. No stubs.
- `frappe.db.commit()` before `publish_realtime()`.
- For ad-hoc DB queries: docker cp + docker exec pattern in CLAUDE.md.

11. **End-of-session git verification — MANDATORY.** Every Claude Code prompt must include in its "Stopping conditions" section: (a) run `git status` and report the output — working directory must be clean (no `M`, no `??`, no untracked files in scope); (b) run `git log <current-branch> --oneline -10` and report output to verify all intended changes are committed. This guards against the failure mode where Claude Code edits files but forgets to `git add` and commit the final round of changes — leaving uncommitted work that gets silently picked up by the next session. (Real lesson from the start of Phase 2a, where uncommitted Phase 1.7 controller and hook changes had to be recovered as the first action of the new session.)

## 15. Open questions

1. **Multiple sheets per Excel.** Import all as one BoQ, prompt user to pick a sheet, or require separate uploads per sheet? *Defer to Phase 3.*
2. **Line item identity across versions.** When v2 is uploaded, how do we map v1 → v2 line items so links carry over? Options: by code field, by description-hash + parent-path, or manual mapping UI. *Defer to Phase 7e.*
3. **Permissions scope.** All internal users see all BoQs, or scoped per project membership? *Resolve in Phase 1, default to project membership matching Procurement Requests conventions.*
4. **Total reconciliation.** If computed total ≠ Excel's stated grand total, warn or block save? *Default warn-only; user can flip a "block on mismatch" flag if needed in a later phase.*
5. **Nirmaan Versions schema.** Does it have a `reason` field? Resolve in Phase 1 first task.

## 16. Glossary

- **BoQ** — Bill of Quantities. Structured list of work items with quantities and rates.
- **Preamble** — section header grouping line items. Nestable to L1/L2/L3.
- **Line item** — single work entry with quantity, unit, and rate(s).
- **Supply rate / Install rate / Combined rate** — material vs labor; sometimes separate, sometimes combined.
- **Pre-tax / Post-tax** — whether quoted rates include taxes. Default pre-tax.

### 2026-05-08 — Phase 1.5: Foundation refinements

**Context:** After Phase 1 tests passed, three real-world BoQ patterns were found to be unsupported by the controller: (1) preambles nested deeper than L3, (2) zero-qty line items (rate-only tender entries), (3) standalone line items with no parent.

**Decisions:**
- **Arbitrary preamble depth:** Remove hard L1/L2/L3 constraint. Validation now accepts `level ≥ 1`, soft-warns above 5. The stack-walk algorithm already handled arbitrary depth; only the validator needed updating.
- **Zero-qty line items:** `if not doc.qty` blocked `qty=0` — changed to `if doc.qty is None`. Auto-set `is_rate_only=True` when `qty==0` and a rate is present. Amount computation fixed: `(supply or install)` was falsy for zero amounts — replaced with `any([supply_rate, install_rate])`.
- **Standalone line items:** `parent_node=None` on a line item now warns rather than throws.
- **Leaf preamble computation:** Leaf preambles (no children) may carry qty/rate silently; non-leaf preambles with qty/rate emit a warning. Detection via `frappe.db.exists("BOQ Nodes", {"parent_node": doc.name})`.

**Consequences:** `is_rate_only` field added to `boq_nodes.json`. Tests expanded from 25 to 33 (8 new, 1 removed, 3 renamed, 1 split into 2).

### 2026-05-06 — Wizard reference is project creation wizard

**Context:** BoQ upload is multi-step (upload → mapping → preview → confirm). Two candidate references in the codebase: project creation wizard and PR approval flow.

**Decision:** Project creation wizard (`frontend/src/pages/projects/project-form/`).

**Alternatives considered:** PR approval flow (`ApproveNewPR/`) — but it's a single-page document review with inline dialogs, not a stepped wizard. Not applicable.

**Consequences:** BoQ upload follows the orchestrator + steps + schema.ts + Zustand draft store + multi-stage progress dialog pattern. File paths in §10.

### 2026-05-06 — Tree storage via self-Link + path, not Frappe is_tree

**Context:** Need to store hierarchical BoQ structure in Frappe.

**Decision:** Standalone `BOQ Nodes` doctype with self-referencing `parent_node` Link and denormalized `path` field. Recursive CTEs for subtree queries. TanStack Table `getSubRows` for client-side rendering.

**Alternatives considered:** Frappe's `is_tree` (lft/rgt nested sets) — no precedent in this codebase, optimized for huge trees with rare writes (opposite of BoQ).

**Consequences:** Simpler mental model, matches codebase conventions. Recursive CTE for any subtree query. `path` recomputed on parent change.

### 2026-05-06 — BOQ Nodes are standalone documents, not child rows

**Context:** Should BoQ line items be a child table on BOQ, JSON field, or standalone doctype?

**Decision:** Standalone `BOQ Nodes` doctype, following the Critical PO Tasks precedent.

**Alternatives considered:** Child table on BOQ (loses individual queryability), JSON field (known migration trap — see `procurement_list` → `order_list` history).

**Consequences:** Each node is independently queryable, updatable, audit-loggable. Slightly more storage overhead, but matches established pattern.

### 2026-05-06 — Audit via Nirmaan Versions, not custom child-table log

**Context:** BoQ nodes editable post-import; need audit trail with reason.

**Decision:** Use the existing Nirmaan Versions pattern. If Nirmaan Versions lacks a `reason` field, add one (cross-cutting improvement).

**Alternatives considered:** Custom `BOQ Node Audit Log` doctype — would duplicate existing audit infrastructure.

**Consequences:** Consistent audit experience across PR/PO/SR/Payment/BoQ. Phase 1 first task: confirm Nirmaan Versions schema, add `reason` if missing.

### 2026-05-06 — AI assist provider is Anthropic Claude, not Document AI

**Context:** Phase 4 needs an AI service to pre-classify columns and rows.

**Decision:** Anthropic API (`claude-sonnet-4-6`). Architecture mirrors `services/document_ai.py` and `api/invoice_autofill.py` (file_url-based, opt-in, confirm-before-save, never auto-persist).

**Alternatives considered:** GCP Document AI — built for structured form extraction (invoices, IDs); poorly suited to free-form spreadsheets with arbitrary layouts. Would require custom processor + labeled training data per BoQ format.

**Consequences:** New external dependency (Anthropic API key). New service module `services/boq_ai_assist.py`. AI is for structure classification only; numerical values always read deterministically from cells.

### 2026-05-06 — Downstream linkages via dedicated standalone doctypes

**Context:** BoQ Nodes need to relate to Work Headers, Milestones, Critical PO Tasks, PR/PO line items, Deliveries.

**Decision:** One linkage doctype per relationship type, each standalone (Critical PO Tasks pattern). BoQ Nodes do not auto-create downstream entities.

**Alternatives considered:** Polymorphic Dynamic Link à la `PO Delivery Documents` — overkill for fixed relationships. JSON field of linked IDs — same migration trap as before.

**Consequences:** Phase 7 splits into 7a–7e, each shipping a focused linkage doctype. Avoids legacy `$#,,,` delimiter pattern from milestone reports.

### 2026-05-06 — Plan + decisions live in `frontend/.claude/plans/`, not `docs/`

**Context:** Where to put feature spec and decisions log.

**Decision:** `frontend/.claude/plans/boq-upload-plan.md` (active plan). After Phase 3 stabilizes, the long-term reference moves to `.claude/context/domain/boq.md`.

**Alternatives considered:** `docs/boq-feature/` — would create a parallel structure inconsistent with the rest of the project.

**Consequences:** Future Claude Code sessions auto-discover the plan via `.claude/context/_index.md` and `frontend/.claude/context/_index.md`.
